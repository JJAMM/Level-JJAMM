# Level-JJAMM

**Joint effort by:** Jerry Smedley, Jacob Hilt, Melissa Barnes, Mark Montes, Anthony Chin

## Description
This repository contains a single player game with various levels for the player to beat. Each level contains obstacles, goals and sometimes enemies. The player will start off without any weapons but as the player progresses they will obtain various weapons. Beware, each enemy type has a weakness to one weapon, so try and figure out which weapon kills which enemies.

## Build and Run
Make sure terminal window is at least 120x30,
or bigger if you are loading a larger file
(the file 'c0.txt', for example, is too large
for a 120 x 30 terminal to run)

To run the program once it is built, enter
./dungeonjjamm

To run the level editor once it is built, enter
./mapCreator
